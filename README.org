#+TITLE: SAT-Solver based on Polynomials

The project aims to solve the famous SAT problem in a efficient way. In order
to do that it's used a different algorithm based on transforming
propositional logic formulas into polynomials and then use the independence
rule (or delta rule). There is further information obout the algorithm in this
[[ ][paper?]].

The documentation about the modules it's hosted [[https://danielrodcha.github.io/SAT-Pol/][here]].

** exDIMACS
This directory stores several examples of sets of formulas in DIMACS format. See [[http://www.satcompetition.org/2009/format-benchmarks2009.html][DIMACS format]] for further
information about it.
*** Trivial Examples
**** example1
+ Corresponds to the formula: (p ^ q)
+ It's True
**** example2
+ Corresponds to the formula: (p ^ q) v (¬p ^ q)
+ It's True
**** example3
+ Corresponds to the formula: (p ^ q) v (¬p ^ q) v (p ^ ¬q)
+ It's True
**** example4
+ Corresponds to the formula: (p ^ q) v (¬p ^ q) v (p ^ ¬q) v (¬p ^ ¬q)
+ It's False
